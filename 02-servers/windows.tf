  # This ensures the latest or specific Windows Server version is used.

  # Defines the compute power of the EC2 instance.

  # since Windows requires more resources than Linux.

  # This determines whether the instance is public or private.

  # SECURITY GROUPS

  # Ensures the instance gets a public IP upon launch for external access.
  # WARNING: This makes the instance reachable from the internet if security groups are misconfigured.

  # Assigns an SSH key pair for secure access.

  # Assigns an IAM role with the necessary permissions for accessing AWS resources securely.
  # This is often used for granting access to S3, Secrets Manager, or other AWS services.

  # USER DATA SCRIPT
  # Executes a PowerShell startup script (`userdata.ps1`) when the instance boots up.
  # This script is dynamically templated with values required for Windows Active Directory setup:
  # - `admin_secret`: The administrator credentials secret.
  # - `domain_fqdn`: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the environment.
  # - `computers_ou`: The Organizational Unit where computers are registered in Active Directory.
